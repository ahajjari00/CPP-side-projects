2D Grading Program

This is a very effective program for calcuating both individual and class
averages on assignments. The code is very flexible as any number of tests and/or students can
be chosen, then the output txt file clearly displays this information in a tabular format. Furthermore, 
can be applied to many, many other applications involving anything that requires information on individual and group 
data to be calculated and displayed.

All the user must do is adjust the two constants at the top of the program to their desired 
parameters.
