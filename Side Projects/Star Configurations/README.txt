This program is more of a visual rather than data driven program that outputs 
a desired shape once run, depending on the user choice. I was motivated to create
this program to teach myself on how to think through an algorithm that may seem simple, but 
requires a deeper level of thinking and even to some extent, an understanding of mathematical 
patterns.
