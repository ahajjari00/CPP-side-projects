The goal of this project is to show how the graph data structure is very useful in storing data in relative locations to one another.
This program utulizes four relative direction pointers (north, south, east, west) to organize the objects, which are represented by 
letters. 
A key feature of this program is that some of the objects are multi-directional in nature, allowing for the same letter to point to 
multiple other letters. This allows for much flexibility and freedom as a designer to organize data.
There is a word document included to show the current "maze" I created to create a visual for what is going behind the scenes. The objects
which are multi-directional are colored differently than the single-directional objects.
Lastly, the implementation behind the Graph library I created is very portable and can be easily templatized for specific applications,
such as flights to specific cities around the world.
