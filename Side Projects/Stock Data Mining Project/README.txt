Stock Data Mining Project

Abstract:
Data is present everywhere in our lives. That does not mean that it can be interpreted easily.
I feel like the words "data" and "information" are interchanged wrongfully in too many contexts.
Data is processed information. The process of converting raw data into something tangible is quite a process. We must
sort, filter, and make visuals in order for us to make educated judgements. This was the
motivation behind my program.

Implementation:
The program I devised is relatively simple, yet portable and effective for many different uses. 
Included in the comments section of the source code, I linked the Yahoo Stock page that I had
used to extract the stock data in CSV format.
In order to run the program with one's one CSV data, all the user needs to do is adjust their CSV file
to the format used in the file titled "adjustStockData" and adjust the one line of code 
(includes simple equation to calculate correct value) to align the number of months/columns in the program
to the CSV file on line 

Output:
The output txt file clearly states the best and worst data points based upon stock closing values of that given time point.
